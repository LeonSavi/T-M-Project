Rasgon explained that while Nvidia shares are up about 30% this year, the stock has stalled since July as other chip stocks kept rising. With earnings forecasts still moving higher, that pause has pushed Nvidia’s valuation down to just under 25 times forward earnings, after a 27% multiple drop this year. The analyst said that number matters because Nvidia rarely trades at these levels. In fact, today’s valuation puts Nvidia in the bottom 11% of its historical range. Nvidia now trades at about a 13% discount to the semiconductor index. Rasgon noted that over the last decade, there have been only 13 days when Nvidia traded cheaper than this relative to the broader chip sector. He said current spending plans still look solid, and demand for Nvidia’s GPUs remains healthy. At the same time, Nvidia’s next-generation platform, Rubin, is moving closer, with upcoming events such as CES and GTC likely to refocus attention on the product roadmap. Looking ahead, Rasgon added that expectations still appear low when compared with Nvidia’s long-term Blackwell and Rubin opportunity, which management has said could exceed $500 billion. Overall, the analyst believes Nvidia’s strong business and reset valuation make the stock attractive at current levels. Is Nvidia a Buy Now, According to Wall Street?

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) cleared the way for Nvidia to invest in Intel. Though it did not illustrate any details of the arrangement, reports noted that Nvidia was planning to put $5 billion in Intel all the way back in September. Naturally, a deal like this is huge for Intel. Intel has been frantically cutting costs for the last several months now, and an extra $5 billion—which represents about a month’s revenue based on third-quarter earnings reports—will certainly help pull cost pressures off of Intel. Further, Intel can benefit greatly from an association with Nvidia, who has delivered consistently in the AI infrastructure arena for years now. That is also a field Intel has been playing catch-up in for almost as long. Increasingly Attractive

Better yet, Intel has a growing body of potential customers, a point it also desperately needs right now. Nvidia and AMD (AMD) are both reportedly looking at the upcoming 14A node for production duties, and both Apple (AAPL) and Broadcom (AVGO) are looking into Intel’s EMIB packaging for a new project: a “custom server accelerator,” reports note.

Trump Admin Launches Review of Nvidia Chip Exports Amid Challenges

Reportedly, the U.S. Commerce Department has forwarded license applications for the chip sales to the State, Energy, and Defense Departments for review. While the Trump administration has launched a review that would allow Nvidia to begin exporting the H200 AI chip to China, the move is drawing opposition from many U.S. politicians. However, experts in the Trump administration argue that shipping advanced AI chips to China discourages Chinese competitors like Huawei from increasing their efforts to compete with Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD) advanced tech. Meanwhile, there is uncertainty about whether the Chinese government will allow companies in the country to buy Nvidia chips. Interestingly, Reuters reported last week that Nvidia is evaluating increasing production of its H200 chips after initial orders from Chinese companies exceeded its existing capacity. Despite ongoing concerns about AI valuations and rising competition in the AI chip space, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Nvidia stock based on 40 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell recommendation.",0.9202805757522583,0.055393628776073456,0.02432580292224884,positive

that state cannot be directly observed, it reflects the combined influence of numerous variables — including institutional activity, macroeconomic conditions, and broader market sentiment — that interact dynamically.', 'Since this underlying state cannot be measured directly, the most practical alternative is to evaluate its expected impact.', 'In other words, while we may not fully

Why Look Beyond Nvidia? Nvidia is still the face of the AI boom, but its share price growth in 2025 has not been as rapid as in recent years. Consequently, rivals such as AMD, Intel (INTC), and custom chips from Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) are gaining ground. As more options enter the market, Nvidia’s pricing power and market share could face pressure. AMD Is Quietly Becoming a Major AI Winner

AMD is becoming a major player in the AI market, with support from its open software ecosystem, fast-growing data center business, and several high-profile partnerships. Its data center business has become a key part of its AI strategy. Importantly, AMD’s hardware is now being deployed by major AI players, including Meta (META), Microsoft, OpenAI (PC:OPAIQ), and Oracle (ORCL). While Nvidia dominates AI training, AMD is focusing on the fast-growing AI inference market, which many analysts expect to become even larger than training workloads. AMD’s Instinct GPUs are built to deliver strong performance at a lower total cost, making them especially attractive to cloud providers facing rising infrastructure expenses. Looking ahead, management expects AMD’s revenue to grow over 35% annually over the next three to five years, a sharp acceleration from its past growth rate. This move could further challenge Nvidia’s dominance in data center GPUs. Conclusion

Nvidia will stay a major player in AI, but investors looking for other options should keep a close eye on AMD. With rising revenue, expanding market share, and a strong product roadmap heading into 2026, AMD seems to have strong upside potential. Is AMD a Buy or Sell Now? Turning to Wall Street, AMD stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 29 Buys and nine Holds assigned in the last three months. At $282.39, the average AMD price target implies a 40.46% upside potential. See more AMD analyst ratings

The timing of the sale stands out because Nvidia stock has climbed about 27% so far this year, pushing the company’s market value to roughly $4.32 trillion and making it the world’s most valuable chipmaker. At the same time, the sale does not change Nvidia’s business outlook. Demand for its AI chips remains strong as cloud providers and large enterprises continue to build out data center capacity. Jones has served on Nvidia’s board since 1993, years before the company went public in 1999.

Nvidia’s GPU Advantage

Nvidia builds GPUs, powerful chips designed to handle heavy computing tasks. While they were first used for gaming, GPUs are now critical for AI, scientific research, and data processing. Bank of America’s five-star-rated analyst Vivek Arya noted that the biggest highlight for Nvidia is its confidence in future demand. He added that today’s top AI models still use Nvidia’s Hopper chips, but the next generation is expected to shift to Blackwell, Nvidia’s new chip launching in early 2026. Nvidia believes Blackwell could be 10 to 15 times more powerful, further widening its lead over competitors. Massive AI Spending Tailwind

Nvidia is a major winner of the global surge in AI spending. As companies and governments pour billions into building AI data centers, Nvidia’s GPUs remain the default choice for training and running advanced AI models. Nvidia is well-positioned to capture a large share of AI investment for years, supporting continued revenue and earnings growth. Looking ahead, Nvidia expects global data-center capital spending to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, up from about $600 billion in 2025. That implies a fivefold increase over the next five years, a trend that strongly supports Nvidia’s growth outlook. Arya believes U.S. semiconductor companies, led by Nvidia, will benefit significantly from this unprecedented surge in AI infrastructure spending. Easing China Worries

Nvidia could also gain from the U.S. government’s decision to allow sales of its advanced H200 chips to China, even though 25% of the revenue would go to the U.S. Treasury. While approvals are not yet guaranteed, the move could mark an important step toward reopening the Chinese market, which once accounted for roughly 20%–25% of Nvidia’s data-center revenue. Nvidia also appears to be preparing for this possibility, as the company may be reviewing its H200 production capacity.

Looking ahead to 2026, Wall Street remains upbeat on AI chips. Morgan Stanley echoed that view, saying next year’s outlook remains solid and continues to favor both Nvidia and Broadcom. Why Nvidia Remains the Core AI Play

Morgan Stanley remains Overweight on both Nvidia and Broadcom, but keeps a clear preference for Nvidia. Moore called Nvidia “the nucleus for the AI trade,” pointing to its strong role across the AI ecosystem. He added that the stock still looks fairly valued given its market lead, and said investors may be underestimating Nvidia’s position. While custom chips are gaining ground, Moore believes Nvidia offers the best value for cloud customers as new system limits appear. That edge should grow as Nvidia’s next platform, Vera Rubin, ramps up in the second half of 2026. Broadcom’s Role Extends Beyond GPUs

Broadcom also plays a key role in Morgan Stanley’s AI outlook. The bank expects strong growth from Broadcom’s custom silicon and data center networking businesses. On alternatives to GPUs, Morgan Stanley actually prefers Broadcom as the most proven accelerator story beyond 2026. Moore said Broadcom’s strength in custom chips and networking gives it lasting appeal, even as Nvidia holds its lead in GPUs. Wall Street’s Take on NVDA and AVGO Stocks

Instagram Reels on TV

According to Meta, the app, which will let users watch Instagram’s short-form video feature Reels on their living room’s TV screen, will initially launch on Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Fire TV platforms. It said after this initial test, Instagram aims to expand onto other TV platforms to reach as many of its users as possible. “Our mission is to get you to the world’s best content fast, and we’re thrilled to welcome Instagram to Fire TV,” said Aidan Marcuss, vice president of Fire TV. “We’re committed to keep pushing the boundaries of entertainment on customers’ biggest screens—the Instagram team has built an awesome experience, and we’re excited to be the first place to offer it. We can’t wait to see what customers think.”

META Needs to Catch Rivals

Instagram boss Adam Mosseri had previously hinted about a TV app back at an event in October. He said then that if people are consuming social media platforms on television then “we need to move to TV too.” He highlighted the success Alphabet’s (GOOGL) YouTube had had on larger screens with its range of TV products. He even said that he wished he had looked into a TV app for Instagram sooner. That is also a recognition that Instagram has a battle ahead wrestling users away from platforms like TikTok and YouTube. For those ready to see their favorite cooks or fashionistas on a large screen then all they need to do is install the Instagram for TV app on their Fire TV device and sign in with their Instagram account.
