After CEO Jensen Huang’s January remarks downplaying near-term quantum breakthroughs, the company is making moves that suggest it’s trying to cause a shift in the space. By championing hybrid quantum systems and positioning its GPUs as central to that future, Nvidia (NVDA) is trying to pull the quantum narrative into its orbit and force the rest of the industry to follow. Within weeks, Nvidia doubled down on its role in shaping the quantum future, not through qubits alone but through its bread and butter: high-performance classical computing. The Hybrid Strategy

At its annual GTC conference, Nvidia unveiled a clear plan. During the event, the company announced the opening of a new Boston-based research center, the Nvidia Accelerated Quantum Research Center, to build “accelerated quantum supercomputers” that merge AI supercomputers with quantum processors. The company also introduced the DGX Quantum platform, which was developed with Quantum Machines and connects Nvidia’s Grace Hopper super chip with low-latency quantum control hardware. The Shift Has Already Begun

Nvidia’s timing couldn’t have been better, as several companies have already started adjusting their messaging and product focus as hybrid computing gains traction. The company has since increased its visibility in Nvidia’s ecosystem, including a presence at the GTC event. Its long-standing roadmap toward 4,000+ qubits and quantum-centric supercomputing gained new relevance, especially as Nvidia’s narrative brought more focus to integrated systems. Nvidia’s Market Strength

Through all this, Nvidia stock remained one of the most stable and attractive tech plays of 2025. For market watchers, Nvidia has become the low-risk quantum exposure. Rather than betting on experimental tech, Nvidia offers a way to invest in quantum progress without the volatility. The Endgame

Nvidia’s quantum efforts have two goals: to support near-term use cases in research and AI, and to shape the long-term future of quantum-classical integration. That’s where Nvidia wants to lead.",0.5573861598968506,0.4315272271633148,0.011086596176028252,positive

lengthy post: “America’s technological strength has always been rooted in the private sector.', 'Today, the United States leads the global AI race thanks to the investment of private capital and innovations by American companies of all sizes, from dynamic start-ups to well-established enterprises.', 'At Microsoft, we’ve seen this firsthand through our partnership with OpenAI, from rising firms such as Anthropic and xAI, and our own AI-enabled software platforms and applications… In FY 2025, Microsoft is on track to invest approximately $80 billion to build out AI-enabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world.', 'More than half of this total investment will be in the United States, reflecting our commitment to this country and our confidence in the American economy.', 'Our success, however, depends on a broad and competitive technology ecosystem, much of which is based on open-source development.', 'This includes our longstanding competitors, chip suppliers, applications companies, systems integrators, service providers, and the millions of software developers who use our products to create customized solutions working for our customers.”\n\nFollowing Smith’s blog outlining the company’s vision for advancing artificial intelligence, Citi kept a Buy rating on Microsoft with a $497 price target.', 'While many aspects were high level around the American opportunity around AI, the call out of the company on track to spend approximately $80B in AI data center capex in fiscal 2025 was particularly notable, the analyst told investors.', 'Citi believes the $80B encompasses essentially all of Microsoft’s data center related spending for fiscal 2025.', 'The $80B is in-line with consensus estimates of total company capex and finance leases of $85B for the year, contends the firm.', 'It says that while the blog numbers don’t suggest a significant surprise, it views the news as a “modest positive” as it “de-risks” a capex cut scenario for Microsoft.', 'In the last week, Morgan Stanley lowered the firm’s price target on Microsoft to $540 from $548 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares.', 'While noting that investor sentiment has shifted negative as a “wall of worry” around gross margins, capex, GenAI monetization and the OpenAI relationship builds, the firm argues that share underperformance and negative investor sentiment create “an attractive setup for the stock to outperform against a stable-to-improving demand backdrop.” Meeting buy-side expectations for 32%-33% constant currency Azure growth in Q2 and “instilling more confidence” in a second half acceleration remain the key catalysts for Microsoft shares, the analyst added in the firm’s preview.', 'STARGATE LAUNCH: On January 21, Microsoft said in a blog post that it is “thrilled” to continue its strategic partnership with OpenAI and to partner on Stargate, a major data center infrastructure investment announced by OpenAI, SoftBank (SFTBY) and Oracle (ORCL).', '“Today’s announcement is complimentary to what our two companies have been working on together since 2019,” Microsoft said.', '“The key elements of our partnership remain in place for the duration of our contract through 2030, with our access to OpenAI’s IP, our revenue sharing arrangements and our exclusivity on OpenAI’s APIs all continuing forward – specifically: Microsoft has rights to OpenAI IP (inclusive of model and infrastructure) for use within our products like Copilot.', 'This means our customers have access to the best model for their needs.', 'The OpenAI API is exclusive to Azure, runs on Azure and is also available through the Azure OpenAI Service.', 'This agreement means customers benefit from having access to leading models on Microsoft platforms and direct from OpenAI.', 'Microsoft and OpenAI have revenue sharing agreements that flow both ways, ensuring that both companies benefit from increased use of new and existing models.', 'Microsoft remains a major investor in OpenAI, providing funding and capacity to support their advancements and, in turn, benefiting from their growth in valuation.', 'In addition to this, OpenAI recently made a new, large Azure commitment that will continue to support all OpenAI products as well as training.', 'This new agreement also includes changes to the exclusivity on new capacity, moving to a model where Microsoft has a right of first refusal.', 'To further support OpenAI, Microsoft has approved OpenAI’s ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.', 'We thank OpenAI for their continued partnership and look forward to what’s to come.”\n\nAfter President Trump and the commercial partners announced the formation of “Stargate,” a “new American company that will invest $500B at least in AI Infrastructure in the United States,” BofA noted that the project is focused on building AI infrastructure with initial equity funders OpenAI, Softbank, Oracle and MGX.', 'BofA analyst Brad Sills says the partnership provides potential scale benefits to Oracle, but adds that details and terms for the agreement were not provided and says it is “unclear where funding for an investment of this scale would come from.” The firm, which also notes that Microsoft stated in a blog that the key terms of the Microsoft OpenAI partnership are unchanged, does not view this joint venture as “a major loss to Microsoft.” Microsoft stated that as part of a new commitment by OpenAI, the companies have made changes to the exclusivity on new capacity, moving to a model where Microsoft has a right of first refusal, adds BofA, which keeps a Buy rating and $510 price target on Microsoft shares.', 'On January 24, Nikkei Asia’s Masayuki

The DeepSeek wipeout did more than topple mega-cap tech stocks during Monday's sell-off — many of the under-the-radar winners of the artificial intelligence boom in the past year also plunged. When the dust settled, Nvidia had lost $589 billion in market cap, and more than $1 trillion in value had been erased from markets. A construction boom in AI data centers pushed utilities to become the third-best-performing sector of the S&P 500 in the first half of 2024, even though the sector typically suffers when growth stocks soar. But many energy, infrastructure, and real-estate stocks, which investors had hoped were less crowded bets than stalwarts like Nvidia, were caught in Monday's sell-off. Shares of the Global X Data Center & Digital Infrastructure ETF tumbled by about 3% and were down by another 1% on Tuesday afternoon. Shares of the fund, which is backed by investments in data centers and other hardware infrastructure, gained 16% in 2024.
