While Nvidia has not commented, these orders could significantly boost revenue if the company manages to deliver the chips before any restrictions take effect. The H20 is currently allowed in China, but it’s less powerful than Nvidia’s Blackwell chips, which are banned due to national security concerns. To improve performance, Nvidia upgraded the H20 by pairing it with high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in its Blackwell systems. As a result, many Chinese firms have ordered this improved version to keep up with the rising demand for AI tools like DeepSeek’s low-cost models. However, Nvidia faces production challenges, as it hasn’t booked enough chip-making capacity with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) to meet the spike in demand. In addition, if the U.S. imposes a ban on these chips before the firm can deliver them, then Nvidia could be left with billions of dollars in unsold chips, especially since the H20 isn’t as appealing outside of China. The risk is even higher for Nvidia due to its competition with Huawei, which CEO Jensen Huang recently called “the most formidable tech company in China.”

The company also introduced the DGX Quantum platform, which was developed with Quantum Machines and connects Nvidia’s Grace Hopper super chip with low-latency quantum control hardware. The Shift Has Already Begun

Nvidia’s timing couldn’t have been better, as several companies have already started adjusting their messaging and product focus as hybrid computing gains traction. The company has since increased its visibility in Nvidia’s ecosystem, including a presence at the GTC event. Its long-standing roadmap toward 4,000+ qubits and quantum-centric supercomputing gained new relevance, especially as Nvidia’s narrative brought more focus to integrated systems. Nvidia’s Market Strength

Through all this, Nvidia stock remained one of the most stable and attractive tech plays of 2025. For market watchers, Nvidia has become the low-risk quantum exposure. Rather than betting on experimental tech, Nvidia offers a way to invest in quantum progress without the volatility.

innovations by American companies of all sizes, from dynamic start-ups to well-established enterprises.', 'At Microsoft, we’ve seen this firsthand through our partnership with OpenAI, from rising firms such as Anthropic and xAI, and our own AI-enabled software platforms and applications… In FY 2025, Microsoft is on track to invest approximately $80 billion to build out AI-enabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world.', 'More than half of this total investment will be in the United States, reflecting our commitment to this country and our confidence in the American economy.', 'Our success, however, depends on a broad and competitive technology ecosystem, much of which is based on open-source development.', 'This includes our longstanding competitors, chip suppliers, applications companies, systems integrators, service providers, and the millions of software developers who use our products to create customized solutions working for our customers.”\n\nFollowing Smith’s blog outlining the company’s vision for advancing artificial intelligence, Citi kept a Buy rating on Microsoft with a $497 price target.', 'While many aspects were high level around the American opportunity around AI, the call out of the company on track to spend approximately $80B in AI data center capex in fiscal 2025 was particularly notable, the analyst told investors.', 'Citi believes the $80B encompasses essentially all of Microsoft’s data center related spending for fiscal 2025.', 'The $80B is in-line with consensus estimates of total company capex and finance leases of $85B for the year, contends the firm.', 'It says that while the blog numbers don’t suggest a significant surprise, it views the news as a “modest positive” as it “de-risks” a capex cut scenario for Microsoft.', 'In the last week, Morgan Stanley lowered the firm’s price target on Microsoft to $540 from $548 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares.', 'While noting that investor sentiment has shifted negative as a “wall of worry” around gross margins, capex, GenAI monetization and the OpenAI relationship builds, the firm argues that share underperformance and negative investor sentiment create “an attractive setup for the stock to outperform against a stable-to-improving demand backdrop.” Meeting buy-side expectations for 32%-33% constant currency Azure growth in Q2 and “instilling more confidence” in a second half acceleration remain the key catalysts for Microsoft shares, the analyst added in the firm’s preview.', 'STARGATE LAUNCH: On January 21, Microsoft said in a blog post that it is “thrilled” to continue its strategic partnership with OpenAI and to partner on Stargate, a major data center infrastructure investment announced by OpenAI, SoftBank (SFTBY) and Oracle (ORCL).', '“Today’s announcement is complimentary to what our two companies have been working on together since 2019,” Microsoft said.', '“The key elements of our partnership remain in place for the duration of our contract through 2030, with our access to OpenAI’s IP, our revenue sharing arrangements and our exclusivity on OpenAI’s APIs all continuing forward – specifically: Microsoft has rights to OpenAI IP (inclusive of model and infrastructure) for use within our products like Copilot.', 'This means our customers have access to the best model for their needs.', 'The OpenAI API is exclusive to Azure, runs on Azure and is also available through the Azure OpenAI Service.', 'This agreement means customers benefit from having access to leading models on Microsoft platforms and direct from OpenAI.', 'Microsoft and OpenAI have revenue sharing agreements that flow both ways, ensuring that both companies benefit from increased use of new and existing models.', 'Microsoft remains a major investor in OpenAI, providing funding and capacity to support their advancements and, in turn, benefiting from their growth in valuation.', 'In addition to this, OpenAI recently made a new, large Azure commitment that will continue to support all OpenAI products as well as training.', 'This new agreement also includes changes to the exclusivity on new capacity, moving to a model where Microsoft has a right of first refusal.', 'To further support OpenAI, Microsoft has approved OpenAI’s ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.', 'We thank OpenAI for their continued partnership and look forward to what’s to come.”\n\nAfter President Trump and the commercial partners announced the formation of “Stargate,” a “new American company that will invest $500B at least in AI Infrastructure in the United States,” BofA noted that the project is focused on building AI infrastructure with initial equity funders OpenAI, Softbank, Oracle and MGX.', 'BofA analyst Brad Sills says the partnership provides potential scale benefits to Oracle, but adds that details and terms for the agreement were not provided and says it is “unclear where funding for an investment of this scale would come from.” The firm, which also notes that Microsoft stated in a blog that the key terms of the Microsoft OpenAI partnership are unchanged, does not view this joint venture as “a major loss to Microsoft.” Microsoft stated that as part of a new commitment by OpenAI, the companies have made changes to the exclusivity on new

The unexpected power of the Chinese startup DeepSeek's R1 AI model threw markets into chaos. Andy Wong/AP

The DeepSeek wipeout did more than topple mega-cap tech stocks during Monday's sell-off — many of the under-the-radar winners of the artificial intelligence boom in the past year also plunged. Panic consumed US investors after the Chinese startup DeepSeek introduced an AI tool said to be cheaper and more powerful and trained on less advanced chip technology. When the dust settled, Nvidia had lost $589 billion in market cap, and more than $1 trillion in value had been erased from markets. A construction boom in AI data centers pushed utilities to become the third-best-performing sector of the S&P 500 in the first half of 2024, even though the sector typically suffers when growth stocks soar. But many energy, infrastructure, and real-estate stocks, which investors had hoped were less crowded bets than stalwarts like Nvidia, were caught in Monday's sell-off. Shares of the Global X Data Center & Digital Infrastructure ETF tumbled by about 3% and were down by another 1% on Tuesday afternoon. Shares of the fund, which is backed by investments in data centers and other hardware infrastructure, gained 16% in 2024. Shares of Super Micro Computer, which counts Nvidia among its customers, slumped by more than 18% from Friday's closing price. The stock soared by triple digits in 2024 on investor bullishness around its business of supplying cooling technology for power-hungry GPU racks.",0.009800364263355732,0.018267428502440453,0.9719322323799133,negative

investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener\n\nArm Holdings Has a Unique Model for High-Margin Growth\n\nAlthough my overall sentiment on the stock is negative, Arm robustly operates a distinct fabless business model, focusing exclusively on designing and licensing semiconductor intellectual property rather than manufacturing physical chips."", 'This has allowed the company to command a gross profit margin of over 95% while earning an upfront fee and collecting ongoing royalties for every chip sold using its designs.', 'Due to the low capital intensity of the business, it is also a consistent free cash flow generator.', 'Arm is known to dominate the smartphone central processing unit intellectual property market, with a 99% share, but it also serves IoT, automotive,

addition, recent technological developments, such as the Armv9 chip architecture, are commanding double the royalty rates of its predecessor, Armv8.', 'This is largely due to enhanced AI and machine learning capabilities, as well as improved energy efficiency.', 'Such Armv9 chips now constitute approximately 25% of Arm’s royalty revenue, with adoption expanding into more markets like data centers and automotive systems.', 'Before we get to my comprehensive valuation analysis, which shows a significant overvaluation in the company’s stock price at present, the operational model and company direction deserve acknowledgment of merit.', 'There are few companies like Arm Holdings with such a moat around a high-growth, recurring revenue business model—this is primarily why the market has become irrationally bullish on the stock and priced it unsustainably.', 'Arm Stock’s Valuation Is Likely Unsustainable\n\nDue to Arm Holdings’ recurring revenue model, it is appropriate to hold its stock for five years or more if the valuation is reasonable.', 'However, as my analysis will show, it is overpriced.', 'Therefore, I am confidently bearish on the stock for now until a better price is offered by the market.', 'To begin the valuation, I will start with the company’s trailing 12-month revenue of $3.535 billion.', 'Currently, it is probable that sales will grow at around a 20% compound annual growth rate over the next five years.', 'Therefore, I forecast that the company will generate $8.79 billion in sales by 2030.', 'Next, it is worth noting that the company’s net margin has come close to 30%, on an adjusted basis, in the past.', 'As a result, it is not unreasonable for profitability to reach a 35% margin by January 2030 due to economies of scale and a stronger moat.', 'Therefore, my conservative January 2030 net income target for Arm Holdings is $3.08 billion.', 'If the company’s diluted share count increases moderately to 1.1 billion, it will then have a diluted earnings per share value of $2.80.', 'Finally, I will select a valuation multiple.', 'Companies in the semiconductor space at the cutting edge typically trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of

Holdings has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, but it is clearly viewed as richly valued, given that the average ARM price target of $154.60 indicates only a potential 4.88% upside over the next 12

Nvidia’s Robot Wars

One reason for my bullishness centers around future technological developments — namely robotics — and Nvidia’s position within this market. Nvidia’s opportunity to dominate the robotics industry is significant, driven by the convergence of powerful AI algorithms, high-performance computing, and advanced sensors. Nvidia’s strategy leverages three critical components:

Omniverse: A powerful simulation platform that enables the creation of high-fidelity “digital twins” for robotic experimentation. High-end GPUs: Cutting-edge hardware like the Blackwell architecture provides the necessary computational power for AI and robotics applications. This ecosystem allows Nvidia to simulate, test, and validate robotics applications at scale, significantly accelerating development and reducing costs. It also has several advantages over robotics peers like Tesla (TSLA), with analysts pointing to Nvidia’s advanced internet-scale data handling, simulation capabilities in the form of the Omniverse platform, and its hardware-software synergy. Nvidia Is Enabling the AI Revolution

Interestingly, it’s Nvidia’s enabling of the AI revolution that makes robotics much more of a reality in the very near future. Moreover, when coupled with Nvidia’s impressive cash flows and financial reserves, it’s not hard to see how Nvidia could dominate. Nvidia’s Foundations for Future Successes

Furthermore, my bullishness is compounded by the company’s financial strength. Nvidia’s impressive quarterly revenue of $35 billion, up 94% year-over-year, and free cash flow of $14.9 billion demonstrates its strong market position and financial health. This financial strength means that Nvidia can comfortably make substantial investments in long-term research and development, strategic acquisitions, and support for developers on its platform. Nvidia is actually taking a collaborative approach to robotics by partnering with multiple robotics firms rather than focusing solely on developing its own humanoid robots. This allows Nvidia to leverage its hardware-software ecosystem efficiently without spending vast sums of money on single projects, which still have high execution risk. For example, the tech giant’s partnership with Figure, a leading humanoid robotics company, sees Nvidia’s Omniverse Isaac Sim utilized for synthetic data generation. AI models are trained on Nvidia’s GPU, and real-time inferencing is run on Nvidia’s accelerated computing modules. Interestingly, the future of robotics is rapidly approaching, with Nvidia set to launch its “Jetson Thor” computing platform in the first half of 2025. Nvidia’s Valuation Remains Justifiable

The core justification for my bullishness is undoubtedly the company’s growth-adjusted valuation. Given this extraordinary growth rate, Nvidia’s price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.19 (non-GAAP forward) is attractively 34.1% lower than the sector median, suggesting that its growth potential may not be fully priced in. This PEG ratio is also 38% lower than Nvidia’s five-year average. While Nvidia’s valuation metrics are generally higher than the sector median (its forward P/E of 46.8x is 81.9% higher than the sector median of 25x), the firm’s superior growth rates and dominant position in AI chips justify the premium.

The Bottom Line on Nvidia Stock

I’m bullish on Nvidia stock for several reasons, including the fact that its dominance in AI hardware and software positions it well to capitalize on the emerging robotics market. With $38.5 billion in cash reserves, Nvidia has ample resources to invest in R&D and strategic acquisitions. From a valuation perspective, Nvidia’s forward P/E of 46.8x and PEG ratio of 1.19 suggest its growth potential isn’t fully priced in despite the stock’s strong performance.",0.7887917757034302,0.20164307951927185,0.009565133601427078,positive

According to analysts at New Street, the change comes upon recognition of the potential of Nvidia’s yet to be released Blackwell chip line, which is now set to release in the first quarter of 2025. “We find the correction healthy overall, recognize some limited and tactical headwinds specific to Nvidia, but overall see the stock moves as an opportunity to gain more exposure,” New Street analysts said.

Nvidia has led the AI revolution but suffered a 10% drop post-stock split. With its market cap soaring over 200% in the past year and briefly entering the $3 trillion club, Nvidia remains a leader in AI, demonstrating impressive growth. After Nvidia unveiled new tools to boost humanoid robotics and AI development at SIGGRAPH 2024, its stock could benefit. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted that these advancements will support global developers in building the next generation of robots. Since Nvidia’s share retreat began on July 10, 2024, four analysts reaffirmed buy ratings and raised their price targets. Benchmark’s Cody Acree lifted his target to $170, citing increased confidence in Nvidia’s AI chip leadership. This highlights confidence in Nvidia’s strong business trends. The expansion could double its AI SuperCluster capacity and enhance its leadership in the AI and data center markets.

will prompt the first decrease in lending rates in four years.', 'Lowered borrowing costs will prompt increases in economic activity at all levels.', 'Businesses will have access to cheaper capital

Regardless of one’s view on NVDA stock, the consensus is that Nvidia’s upcoming fiscal second-quarter earnings report – scheduled for August 28 – will be especially critical. For example, in Q2 of Fiscal 2024, Nvidia posted earnings per share of 27 cents, beating the consensus view of 21 cents. Essentially, analysts are getting a bit jaded about Nvidia constantly beating per-share profitability estimates. Both things can be true: Nvidia can be a great long-term investment thanks to its numerous innovations, and it could also be due for a correction. At that point, Nvidia would look extremely enticing on the long side. See more NVDA analyst ratings

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock fell 11% overnight as the stock rout accelerated. Is Nvidia a Bargain? The overnight fall left Nvidia with a market capitalization of $2.35 trillion. Nvidia is scheduled to release its second-quarter earnings on Aug. 28. Before the market fell analysts were putting a price target of $144 per share on Nvidia stock. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) said it will have 350,000 Nvidia H-100 chips online by the end of the year. Nvidia is already building generative artificial intelligence (AI) models based on Meta’s Llama 3.1 Large Language Model (LLM). Nvidia’s dominance of the AI market is based on software as much as hardware. Nvidia Cuda software is a de-facto industry standard, and it has built application program interfaces (APIs) on top of it. Nvidia is likely to bounce quickly off its lows. More From InvestorPlace

Looking ahead to the second half of the calendar year 2025 and beyond, Arya expects Nvidia to recover from any initial launch issues, with the potential for significant year-over-year sales and profit growth. Additionally, he acknowledges the complexity of the Blackwell product due to its high-power density and advanced packaging, but he believes that Nvidia has viable workarounds that can mitigate these challenges. Arya covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Micron. Nvidia (NVDA) Company Description:

On the surface, that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) was going to spend approximately $38.5 billion in 2024 on AI infrastructure was very good news for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. “Meta is one of Nvidia’s top customers. In January, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged that his company would have 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units and a total of nearly 600,000 H100 compute equivalent GPUs by the end of this year,” wrote Barron’s contributors Adam Clark and Tae Kim on Aug. 1. That’s good news for Nvidia stock, right? Which begs the question: What is the downside for Nvidia stock if AI doesn’t stick? There is no question that if the tech gods could turn off the AI switch tomorrow, Nvidia stock would not be trading in triple digits for very long. In Q1 2025, its data center revenue, which is primarily AI-driven, had revenue of $22.6 billion, accounting for 87% overall, growing by 23% on a sequential basis from Q4 2024. So, even though Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been focused on AI since 2006, when he began marketing GPUs (graphics processing units) to the supercomputing community; AI had been around in one form or another for 56 years before Huang got involved. Nvidia Has Other Irons in the Fire

Nvidia has two reportable segments: Compute & Networking, which includes its data center revenue and AI, and Graphics, which accounts for 13% of its overall revenue. That is then broken down into four businesses: Gaming (77% of graphics revenue), Professional Visualization (12%), Automotive (9%), and OEM and Other (2%). In Q1 2025, all four businesses in the Graphics segment grew revenues year-over-year, with the largest, Gaming, 18% higher than a year ago, to $2.65 billion. As the company said in its Q1 2025 presentation, it has experienced strong demand for its GeForce RTX 40 Super GPU. Especially popular with PC gamers is the GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, which is said to be experiencing supply issues. While that’s not good, the line of GPUs is evidence the company has other irons in the fire beyond AI. Huang Has the Vision to Stay Ahead of the Crowd

The one thing I’m not concerned about is CEO Jensen Huang losing his vision for the future of his company and the tech industry. One area where Huang leads Nvidia is robotics. We are working to accelerate generative physical AI by advancing the NVIDIA robotics stack, including Omniverse for simulation applications, Project GR00T humanoid foundation models, and the Jetson Thor robotics computer,” Cyber News Centre reported Huang’s comments. Nvidia remains a lifetime buy. More From InvestorPlace

Wall Street has been hammering the shares of Meta Platforms after the company reported its second straight quarterly revenue decline after the market close Wednesday. The share price slide is also chipping a chunk off CEO Mark Zuckerberg's rapidly shrinking fortune. In a Thursday note, Bank of America cut Meta's price target from $150 to $136, with analysts citing further deceleration in ad revenue, lofty metaverse investments that are seemingly permanent, and uncertainty around the company's transition to reels. ""On a total company basis, including metaverse investments, our valuation reflects a discount to S&P 500, given decelerating topline growth, increasing competition for user attention & advertising dollars, and large Metaverse investments pressuring earnings,"" BofA maintained.

The bank also noted that despite Meta's large investments in its metaverse department, it remains unclear what that will actually look like.

examination."", 'A bet on the future\n\nThe idea of labor hoarding is basically an assumption about the bet that companies are making on the future of the labor market and customer demand.', 'If companies assume labor markets are going to be tight — that wages are going up and the job market is going to tilt in the favor of workers — employers may be willing to suffer smaller profits or weaker productivity to hold on to workers.', 'If they assume labor markets are going to be loose — that workers will be easy to find and willing to take lower wages to secure employment — companies will eliminate jobs as a first line of defense for profitability in a downturn.', 'This was one of the explanations for the surge in hiring in the early 2010s: People attributed it to companies ""hoarding"" cheap workers because they expected wages to start rising.', 'This time around, the labor market is already tight, so labor-hoarding proponents assume businesses are betting that predictions of a recession are overblown and they need to be ready for customer demand to stay strong.', ""Since it's already expensive to hire workers, they'd rather just ride out the economic soft patch with the workers they have — sacrificing productivity to hang on to every worker in case spending bounces back down the road."", 'Similarly, companies can make predictions on the future of consumer demand and adjust their costs based on those expectations.', 'A business that assumes demand will hold up or bounce back will always be hesitant to cut costs by selling off their backlog of products at a discount, selling off assets like equipment or buildings, or firing workers since the firm would miss out on higher profits when demand recovers.', 'It can be perfectly rational for a business to rack up costs now holding on to a stockpile of hard-to-acquire inputs (including labor) if that means those inventories are available later.', 'In an environment where every conceivable input has gone through one shortage or another, including workers, it makes sense that businesses are focused on production headaches down the road.', 'In this narrow sense, labor hoarding is a very real thing: Businesses may be slightly slower to lay off people than they otherwise would have been, even in the face of slowing customer demand.', ""That said, it's important not to overstate this shift."", 'In the chart below, I compare the number of hires businesses are making with the number of layoffs, firings, and other discharges.', 'As shown, while layoffs are very low, they are starting to rise.', 'Similarly, hiring rates have definitely started to slow down.', 'The slowdown in hiring is an even more important signal of changing attitudes around the job market — businesses are more likely to adjust how many new employees they bring on in times of weakness before they shift to shedding workers.', 'Today, high but falling hiring rates show businesses are proving very successful at attracting workers but putting less effort into it.', ""Another helpful tool to see how businesses are adapting to the labor market is the Bureau of Labor Statistics' quarterly Business Employment Dynamics report."", 'It strips out the volatile hires and layoffs made when businesses open and close and focuses instead on the employment changes at existing companies — which give a better indication of how firms are thinking about the job market.', 'When we look only at existing establishments, we see that through the end of 2021 (the latest data available) job losses were low but at a relatively similar level to before the pandemic: with more than 5 million people fired each quarter.', 'Sure, hiring was much more important — existing establishments created millions of net jobs per quarter — but in an environment where businesses were desperate to hang on to employees, as the labor-hoarding theory goes, we would expect to see much more extreme declines in firing.', ""Instead, we're seeing a more-balanced response consistent with a tight labor market that is losing some steam."", 'Additionally, for the hoarding narrative to hold up, businesses must also be holding on to workers despite weakening sales.', 'As the economy surged out of the COVID-19 recession, real consumer spending soared by leaps and bounds, surpassing the pre-pandemic peak, and then some, by mid-2021.', 'Theseincreased sales justified hiring more workers to fulfill that demand.', 'So far in 2022, growth in real consumer spending has slowed but not yet declined.', 'If businesses are going to hoard labor despite weak consumer demand, then consumer demand has to weaken first.', ""So far, that hasn't happened."", ""Just you wait …\n\nThrough this whole discussion, we haven't focused much on the most important factor that undermines the labor-hoarding thesis: The job market is a lagging indicator."", 'Today\'s ""labor hoarding"" could easily turn out to be a late reaction from employers who\'re not yet responding to weaker demand.', 'To illustrate this, the charts below show the average of two economic variables for every recession since 1953 through 2007.', ""The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing purchasing managers' index, a survey of senior executives at manufacturing firms, tends to capture real-time economic conditions quite well: It typically begins to contract the month before a recession starts and hits the bottom about half a year after the start of a recession."", ""Unemployment, on the other hand, may start ticking up slightly around the start of a recession, but it doesn't peak until 1 ½ years after the recession starts."", ""Just because companies are holding on to workers now doesn't mean that will be the case when things get ugly."", 'Because labor markets lag, caution around rosy predictions for how companies will react to a weakening economy is always needed.', ""In November 2007, the jobs report showed that the US added 166,000 jobs, well above economists' estimates."", 'The strength of the labor market led to skepticism that the subprime-mortgage crisis was all that much to be worried about — a month later the most severe recession since the Great Depression started.', 'Even now, there are signs from specific sectors hit hardest by the recent market mess that layoffs are coming.', 'From 2013 to 2021, the phrase ""tech layoffs"" appeared in Bloomberg News stories only 637 times.', 'From May to September this year alone, that number was more than 960 as tech companies ranging from the gigantic Meta to much-smaller companies that recently debuted on public markets via special-purpose acquisition companies,laid off workers or reduced head count.', ""Over the past few months, we've also started to see the segments of the labor market most sensitive to interest-rate hikes shed employees: Loan-brokerage employment is down almost 3% from its April peak, while employment at real-estate firms is down 1% amid still rapid payrolls growth across most other industries."", 'The theory of labor hoarding rests on hopeful assumptions.', ""Maybe the Federal Reserve's inflation fighting won't push the US into a deep recession."", 'Maybe companies will refuse to cut costs even when demand weakens.', 'Maybe workers will be able to retain some of the gains they made earlier in the pandemic.', ""But we're already seeing some weakness on the edges of America's job market at the very beginning of what could be a Fed-induced recession."", ""So when the real pain starts, there's a good chance the US will quickly shift from labor hoarding to layoffs."", 'George Pearkes is the Global Macro Strategist for Bespoke Investment Group.']",,0.3591632843017578,0.4241848289966583,0.21665190160274506,neutral

Instagram is dipping its toes even further into influencer marketing with a new internal prototype. The prototype was first spotted by Italian mobile developer Alessandro Paluzzi, who reverse engineers Instagram code to produce renderings of prototypes before they launch to the public. Influencer media kits typically summarize their audience, engagement, and experience on social media — a sort of influencer resume. Providing creators with the option to make an Instagram-native media kit would follow the platform's already apparent path toward inserting itself deeper into influencer marketing (an entire industry that in part came about because of Instagram).
