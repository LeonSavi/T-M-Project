## Project assignment
1. Overview
Assignment Two is a group assignment, accounting for 50% of the total grade for this course. Each group consists of 3 or 4 students. It has two components: a group presentation (30%) and a research report (70%). You will need to complete a 360-degree peer review form that indicates who contributed in which way to the project (will be available on Brightspace).
The assignment assesses the research group's:
    • Understanding of how to apply text and media analytics to studying real-world phenomena.
    • Ability to formulate research questions that are appropriate to the research data and methods.
    • Capacity for critical reflection on the limitations of computational methods and data-driven approaches.
    • Proficiency in collaboratively undertaking group projects and effectively reporting and discussing key findings.
2. The assignment
The assignment is to conduct a study to answer a scientific question through a text and media analytics approach. You have the freedom to follow your own interest: formulate a research question with societal relevance and choose the proper data and methodology to answer this. You can either make use of one of the provided datasets or collect data yourself. You are also free to apply unsupervised or supervised approaches, or work with language data or image data (or both), as long as the study comprises text and media analytics. In case of doubt you can consult with your seminar teacher. The output of your project is threefold: written and comprehensible code, an oral presentation and a written report. 

3. Presentation
The presentations will be held in Week 9 (January 20, 2026) during your seminar's designated time slot. The order of presentations will be announced in Week 8 by your seminar instructor. Each presentation should not exceed 10 minutes in length, followed by a 3–5 minutes’ Q&A session. During this session, the group will address questions from classmates and/or the instructor. Presentation slides are mandatory and should be submitted along with the research report (please refer to the instructions in Section 4). The evaluation of the presentation will consider its content, presentation style, and how the group responds to questions. The students have the freedom to choose the style and format of their presentation. The following elements should be considered:
    - Research questions
    - A brief literature review to justify and contextualise the chosen research topic
    - Describe the dataset & data analysis
    - Discussion of (preliminary) results & conclusion
4. Research report
The written report should be submitted by February 2nd, 2026, 9AM. The word limit of the report is 4,000 words, excluding references, the appendix, table of contents, and the title page. Groups have the flexibility to select one of the provided datasets and formulate their own research questions (RQs). Additionally, students can choose to gather their own data, either from the realm of social media or other media sources. If you intend to collect your own data, please consult with your seminar instructor for guidance and coordination. Below is the recommended structure of the report:
- Title Page: Include the following elements:
    - Title of the paper
    - All students' full name
    - All students' student number
    - Seminar group and instructor's name
    - Word count
- Introduction:
    - Introduce the research question and explain its importance or relevance.
    - Provide a brief description and justification for your approach to addressing it.
- Literature review:
    - Provide definition of key concepts (when applicable)
    - Provide a brief overview of related literature
- Data & Methodology:
    - Provide a brief description of the dataset used. If you collect your own data, please also include data collection methods.
    - Ethics consideration of the study (when applicable)
    - Describe and rationalise the methods employed to answer the proposed RQ
    - Describe and motivate the experimental set-up, including the way in which performance is evaluated
- Results:
    - Present key findings related to the research question, including relevant tables and graphs when necessary.
- Discussion and Conclusion:
    - Summarise the study conducted.
    - Discuss briefly the main implications and/or explanations of the findings.
    - Provide a brief reflection on the limitations of the study and recommendation for future research.
- References:
    - Format the references following APA style. Refer to the University library's APA guidelines for more information (https://libguides.library.uu.nl/citing/APA).
5. Submission
Materials associated with the assignment should be submitted through Brightspace, by one person from your group, latest on February 2nd 2026, 9AM. The name of all uploaded files should include information about the seminar group and the project group, i.e “SG[seminar group number]_[project group number]”. For instance, the report and notebook from project group 3 in Seminar Group 2 should be named as “SG2_G3.docx” and “SG2_G3.ipynb” respectively. The following files need to be uploaded:
    - The report should be submitted as a word document (.docx). If your group works with LaTex, PDF submission is also acceptable.
    - Submit the code as an .ipynb file. The notebook should be clearly presented and structured. Only the analysis mentioned in the research report should be included. Brief explanations should be used to explain the key steps of the analysis in the notebook.
    - The presentation slides (.pdf or .pptx).
    - The 360-degree form, which indicates who contributed in which way to the project.
Any suspicious cases of fraud & plagiarism will be forwarded to the examination board for assessment. Note that students are prohibited from using ChatGPT to generate text for assignments and tests. Presenting generated text as one's own work constitutes undeniable fraud.
